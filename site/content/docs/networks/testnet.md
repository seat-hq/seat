## Deployed SEAT contracts

From `app/src/lib/addresses.ts` (generated from the broadcast log; see `docs/phase-1-live.md` for the deploy runbook):

| Contract | Address |
|---|---|
| DeskFactory | `0x4c58691ad3395d9a9fa078b2d86a1c5d90a73e10` |
| DeskVault (bootstrap desk) | `0x8ff6ef04312679a0112b5229c6911cbc026e73ff` |
| RiskModule | `0x48a0733a5b7b7ae1c98d29712cc639f33bcb2147` |
| SwapAdapter | `0xff8851ea3699781c6c331ee9530d7831cc465f02` |
| FeeModule | `0x475d9d5a7d1b839845ee1073c5a0c51320064408` |
| ChainlinkOracle | **not deployed** (`null`) |

:::callout{type="info" title="Cash-only by design"}
The testnet deploy has **no router configured** (`SwapAdapter.router == address(0)`), so `executeCopy` always reverts and the vault holds cash only. This is the deliberate Phase 1 posture: deposits, shares, fees, and the withdrawal queue are live; execution is not. See [Phase 1 runbook](/docs/runbooks/phase-1-live).

## Getting testnet funds

The repository does not document a faucet. You need testnet ETH for gas and testnet USDG for deposits; obtain them through Robinhood Chain testnet channels. Do not bridge or send mainnet assets.
